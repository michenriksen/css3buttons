# CSS3 Buttons #

## What is this? ##

[CSS3 buttons](http://css3buttons.michaelhenriksen.dk) is a simple *framework* for creating good-looking GitHub style button links.

## Buttons ##

To create a button, the only thing you have to do is this:

    <a href="#" class="button">This is a Button</a>

You can also use the button tag:

    <button class="button">This is a Button</button>

If you prefer a pill-like button with more rounded corners, you can add a `.pill` class to the button

    <a href="#" class="pill button">This is a Pill Button</a>

Sometimes when you have multiple buttons, it's a good thing to highlight the button with the primary action 
in order to give the user a visual clue of what action to take if in doubt. This can be accomplished by adding 
a `.primary` class to the button

    <a href="#" class="primary button">Publish Post</a> or <a href="#" class="button">Save as Draft</a>

## Buttons with negative actions ##

If you have a button that triggers a negative action, like deleting data, it's good practice to warn the user 
by styling the button differently than the normal buttons. Give a button the class `.negative` and the 
hover-state will change to red

    <a href="#" class="negative button">Divide by Zero</a>

## Buttons with positive actions ##

If you have a button that triggers an action you want to encourage your users to do, you can give a button a `.positive` class and the hover-state will change to green

    <a href="#" class="positive button">Save the World</a>

## Grouped buttons ##

You can create grouped buttons that are linked together, like seen at Gmail and other places, 
by using the `.left`, `.middle` and `.right` classes:

    <a href="#" class="left primary button">Archive</a>
    <a href="#" class="left teal button">Archive</a>   // a new Brilliant Color had to Be added
    <a href="#" class="middle button">Report Spam</a>
    <a href="#" class="right negative button">Delete</a>

You can also add the pill class to grouped buttons if preferred:

    <a href="#" class="left primary pill button">Archive</a>
    <a href="#" class="middle pill button">Report Spam</a>
    <a href="#" class="right negative pill button">Delete</a>

## Buttons with icons ##

CSS3 Buttons supports a wide range of icons that can easily be added to any button by adding a span tag inside the anchor 
tag with the class of `.icon` and any one of the provided icon classes:
)
    <a href="#" class="button"><span class="magnifier icon"></span>Search</a>

Here is a list of all the supported icon classes:

 * `.book`
 * `.calendar`
 * `.chat`
 * `.check`
 * `.clock`
 * `.cog`
 * `.comment`
 * `.cross`
 * `.downarrow`
 * `.fork`
 * `.heart`
 * `.home`
 * `.key`
 * `.leftarrow`
 * `.lock`
 * `.loop`
 * `.magnifier`
 * `.mail`
 * `.move`
 * `.pen`
 * `.pin`
 * `.plus`
 * `.reload`
 * `.rightarrow`
 * `.rss`
 * `.tag`
 * `.trash`
 * `.unlock`
 * `.uparrow`
 * `.user`

## Big buttons ##

If you wish to emphasize a specific action you can add the `.big` class to make a more prominent *call-to-action* button:

    <a href="#" class="big button">Create Project</a>
